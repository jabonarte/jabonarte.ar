# Task ID: 33
# Title: Optimize Performance and Implement Lazy Loading
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 28, 29, 30, 31, 32
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations, lazy loading, and bundle optimization for production
# Details:
1. Configure lazy loading for all feature modules:
   - Implement loadChildren for each route
   - Add preloading strategy for critical modules
2. Optimize images and assets:
   - Implement WebP format with fallbacks
   - Add responsive image loading
   - Compress and optimize all static assets
3. Implement OnPush change detection strategy:
   - Update components to use OnPush
   - Optimize component rendering cycles
4. Add service workers for caching:
   - Configure Angular PWA features
   - Implement offline functionality
5. Optimize bundle size:
   - Tree-shake unused dependencies
   - Split vendor and app bundles
   - Configure webpack optimizations
6. Implement performance monitoring:
   - Add Core Web Vitals tracking
   - Monitor loading times and user interactions

# Test Strategy:
Measure Core Web Vitals (FCP < 1.5s, LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, FID < 100ms), test lazy loading functionality, verify offline capabilities, check bundle size optimization
